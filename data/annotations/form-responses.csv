Furthermore, he had no manner of judicial redress available regarding these allegations of anti-social behaviour. He argued that the Respondent State could have taken other measures against the anti-social behaviour displayed by his guests, over which himself personally had no control.

Moreover, the Court finds that the applicant did not have access to procedural safeguards (such as judicial review or challenging the Council which ordered the eviction). Thus, the Court finds that  the Respondent State has not managed to present a specific goal or benefit as to justify why the burden of giving reasons cannot be placed onto itself in relation to such sites. Therefore, the interference is not necessary in a democratic society and disproportionate, constituting a violation of Art. 8. ",81-95,Non-pecuniary damage,N/A,N/A,"EUR 14,000",114-115

Thus, the national courts have failed to meet their positive obligation to ensure the protection of the applicant's rights under the Convention. Moreover, the Court finds that the Institute (a public authority) also failed to offer any redress to the applicant while his apartment was unlawfully occupied and that upon repossession, the Institute failed to meet its obligation and repair the damage which made the apartment uninhabitable.

The rationale behind the specific section of the Housing Act was to terminate the specially protected tenancy of those persons who during the war in Croatia had served in the enemy’s army as the State authorities could not have tolerated a situation in which such persons would be allowed to continue using flats which had been owned by the State (or other public authorities) they had fought against. That provision was therefore enacted in the interests of national security. Therefore, the Court considers that it cannot be argued that in the present case the domestic authorities failed to discharge their obligation to strike a fair balance between the general interest involved and the protection of the applicant’s right to respect for her home.

The Court reiterates that the loss of one's home is the most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home, any person risking this – whether or not belonging to a vulnerable group – should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under that Article. The Court finds that thee applicant built the house on forest land in conscious defiance of the prohibitions of the law, since he only tried to change the legal status of his house after the demolition notice. The domestic authorities took various measures aimed at providing the applicant with opportunities to improve his situation. In particular, at the applicant’s request, the Inspectorate extended the time-limit for demolishing the house.

Therefore, the Court accepts their conclusion that the applicant had never acquired a specially protected tenancy of that flat and thus had no legal basis to occupy it. The Court also recognises and accepts that an owner of a flat, be it a private individual or the State, has the right to dispose freely of that property. Thus, an eviction order against a tenant occupying a flat owned by a third party issued on the grounds that the tenant is occupying a flat without a valid legal basis is not as such contrary to the Convention, regard being had to the guarantees under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 ECHR. Furthermore, Art. 8 ECHR does not guarantee the right to purchase a flat. Thus, the Court does not see any appearance of a violation of Art. 8 ECHR.",,No damages,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

The national authorities have a certain margin of appreciation in making this decision but the procedural safeguards of Article 8 need to be respected.  Here the Court notes that the reasonableness of the measure and the circumstances of the applicant have been duly assessed by the national Courts. The applicant’s argument related to her old age and problems in moving were taken into account but this could not lead to any different conclusion, it being her own and her son’s acts that had led to the impugned order of compulsory sale. Further the Court notes that the applicant did not complain about possible homelessness following the compulsory sale of the apartment. ",136-144,No damages,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

However, the boundaries between the State's positive and negative obligations under Art. 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition. In determining whether or not such an obligation exists, regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the general interest and the interests of the individual; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation. The Court notes that due to the fact that the Zagreb Municipal Court's judgment ordering the eviction of S.Ž. was not executed for a prolonged period of time, the applicant was prevented from living in her home for a period of more than three years after the Convention entered into force in respect of Croatia.

Since there have been eviction orders submitted against applicants nos. 2, 6 and 8, the Court is of the opinion that these elements (their financial situation and personal circumstances) should be taken into account in the evaluation of the proportionality of the interference. The Court reiterates that the suppression of the specially protected tenancies and their replacement with normal lease contracts had a valid legal basis in domestic law  and that the interference with the applicants’ rights pursued a legitimate aim, namely the protection of the rights of others. In assessing the proportionality of the measure, the Court notes that the applicants were afforded the possibility of concluding leases of an indefinite duration, transmitting them to their spouses or long term partners and occupying the premises for a non-profit rent, the rent was also considerably lower. The applicants further had the possibility to challenge the measures in front the competent domestic court, the procedural aspects of Article 8 were therefore respected.

The public authorities had not taken account to minimum safeguards during the procedures. The measure did not pursue a legitimate aim and was not necessary in a democratic society. Neither did the applicants have the proportionality of the measure assessed. The applicants also complained of the manner in which the eviction had been carried out (at night, without prior notice and with a significant police presence). Lastly, the balance between the interests at stake should lead to the conclusion that the applicants’ eviction and the demolition of their home had not been necessary or urgent, and caused irreparable damage – particularly to the minor children – on the basis that the public authorities had not provided credible and permanent alternative housing.",44-48,Yes,53-55,Yes,N/A,Yes,N/A,Yes,N/A,"The Court reiterates that it does not matter that the applicants have constructed the house unlawfully, as the concept of “home” within the meaning of Article 8 is not limited to those premises which are lawfully occupied or which have been lawfully established. “Home” is an autonomous concept which does not depend on classification under domestic law. As the lawfulness of the interference was not disputed, the Court further states that an interference will be considered “necessary in a democratic society” for a legitimate aim if it answers a “pressing social need” and, in particular, if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. While it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of necessity, the final evaluation as to whether the reasons cited for the interference are relevant and sufficient remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention. The Court observes further that the unlawful occupation of public land in the Cañada Real Galiana had been de facto tolerated by the authorities for decades, however, there have been multiple incidences where the applicant was told to stop the construction of the house. Further, the applicants were able to challenge the first demolition order, but did not do so, however, after the first demolition of his home the first applicant started to rebuilt his home.

The Court notes that the applicants were unable to gain access to and use their homes, and that access was only possible if a certificate of ownership and valid ID were presented to the authorities. Accordingly, this constituted an interference by a public authority with their right to respect for their homes.

Furthermore, the Court notes that the practice of police forces preventing people from entering their homes without any legal basis, and the seizure and cordoning off of a building contrary to domestic (Albanian) law, are not compatible with the rule of law in a democratic society respecting the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention.","112, 114-115, 117",Both pecuniary damage and non-pecuniary damage,"EUR 13,098,600",198,"EUR 7,800 (for 1st applicant) + EUR 7,800 (for 2nd applicant)",204

In this respect, in addition to the negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private life. A State has obligations of this type where there is a direct and immediate link between the measures sought by an applicant and the latter’s private life.

However, the Court considers that no positive obligation for the local authorities can be inferred from Article 8 to provide the applicant with a specific apartment. As such, they can be considered to have discharged their positive obligations in respect of the applicant’s right to respect for his private life.

As to the applicant’s argument that the owner of the flat owned other habitable property capable of satisfying his or his children’s housing needs, the Court notes that she did not adduce any evidence in support of that argument nor demonstrated that she had raised it before the domestic courts. Having regard to the margin of appreciation left to the States in housing matters, the Court considers that in the instant case it cannot be argued that by ordering the applicant to vacate the flat in question the domestic courts failed to discharge their obligation to strike a fair balance between the competing interests involved.

communist rule in Bulgaria. The Commission further notes that according to the law in force since June 1996 the applicants can claim from the State the price of the apartment, adjusted to reflect its market value as of the date of the eviction.  Moreover, they are entitled to a rent allowance for the period of time between the eviction and the receipt of the amount due in respect of the price of the apartment.
